# You Cannot Please Everyone
It has been said that wisdom knows you cannot please everyone. There will always be those dissapointed with your decisions. There will always people looking for an investment of your time and attention. You must seek to understand others, why they many want your help, how you can help them. Be generous with your time and energy. However, one must alwasy be cautious. Determine if you can give what is asked of you. Determine what your goals are. Determine what path you are one. Follow your intuition and instincts. In so doing, you can seek to maintain a holistic appraoch to your life. 

Know your path and follow it. I compare this to a great long walk in the woods. If walk down every side path, you'll never arrive at your destination and  get lost doing so. And once you walked long enough to gain perspective, you might just realize that the best possible path is the one you are on. Sure, there is a steep cliff at all times forcing you to face the possibility of failure. But the steepness of the side of the trail give you the presepective of the beauty in which you are walking. And while it is entertaining to consider all of the beautiful places the side paths may lead. With perspective, you many just realize that coming full circle is a perfectly well and harmonious goal.
