# What's Important
It's important to stay positive. Because once one has become accustomed to negative vibrations, they find it
difficult to avoid falling into those negative states. As their inertia returns them to negativity more and more quickly, they eventually find it impossible to escape negativity. By this point in time, such a person has become
a signficant problem for the other people around them. This is why it's important to stay positive. You musn't wait for everyone else to change before you are able to do so. You must find a way to stay positive. This is how you change the world and influence others. Because others can only see what's above the clouds. And because we can't have it all, it's so beautiful to have any piece of the pie.
