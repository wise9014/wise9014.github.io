# Welcome
The potential for epistemic conflict exists whenever one commits the majority of their belief to single outcomes. If one holds more bleif in a range of possiblities, in uncertainty, in recognition of ignorance, then there is little room for conflict. However, by commiting one's blief, conflict seems to necessarily arise.
