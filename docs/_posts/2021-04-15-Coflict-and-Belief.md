The potential for epistemic conflict exists whenever one commits the majority of their belief to single outcomes. If one holds more bleif in a range of possiblities, in uncertainty, in recognition of ignorance, then there is little room for conflict. However, by commiting one's blief, conflict seems to necessarily arise.

# Basics of Markdown
Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create *websites*,*ebooks*,*email*,*chats in discussions forums*.

## Topics
1. Paragraphs 

    MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.
2.  Text decorations

    MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ *italic*  texts
3. Headings
    No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked.

    ### This is h3
