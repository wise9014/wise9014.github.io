## Who Am I?

Hello, my name is William Seites-Rundlett, but you can call me Bill or Billy. I am originally from South County, Rhode Island. I attended the University of Rhode Island from 2007-2012, where I majored in Civil Engineering and German Language and Literature. As an undergraduate, I spent most of my time working for either the Rhode Island Department of Transportation as a construction intern or for the Academic Enhancement Center as a math/science tutor. Addtionally, I spent a year abroad in Germany as an undergrad, studying at the Technical University of Braunschweig and completing an internship with the German construction giant Hochtief AG. 

Upon graduating summa cum laude, phi beta kappa, etc., I took a job as a structural engineer at the largest employer in my hometown, General Dynamics Electric Boat. I learned a lot at this job. Chiefly, I learned an appreciation for engineering systems, by observing the complex interactions of decisions, optimization, and design philosophy required to build something like a submarine.

After a few years working hard in the office, I took a year off to explore the western half of the country. I ski bummed around from Colorado to Washington. I backpacked in the Sawtooth, Bitteroot, and Bob Marshall wilderness areas of Idaho and Montana. I gained experience living off grid and growing vegtables in California. I perfected my baking skills in formely quiet mountain Town of Crested Butte. 

Ultimately, at the start of 2018 I arrived in Boulder, Colorado to begin my graduate studies in Civil Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was specifically attracted to boulder for the opportunity to complete another intership abroad. I accomplished this goal by working for the International Federation of Red Cross/Crescent Societies (IFRC) at the Philippine Red Cross headquarters in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines. I have remained at CU as a graduate research assistant advised by professors Dr. Cristina Torres-Machi and Dr. Ross B. Corotis. My research focuses on analysis of uncertain data for use in modeling and decision making of infrastructure systems.
